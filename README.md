## Description
For this project, I re-wrote my previous portfolio using react. My previous portfolio can be found here: 

- Link to GitHub repository: https://github.com/Tzcodes101/updatedPortfolio
- Link to live site: https://tzcodes101.github.io/updatedPortfolio/

This react portfolio features "About Me" and "My Portfolio" pages. The portfolio features homework assignments and group projects I feel went well. The code for these items can be accessed through the portfolio section on the site. My GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume can be accessed from the "About Me" section.
